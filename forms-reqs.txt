- initial values in ~ props
- submit outside of form (not button type=submit)
- must have isDirty on form (& possibly fields)
- validation as functions
- validation f per field
- validation results accessible from outsides (callback with validation results?)
- strong typed field values (FormProps<MyFieldValies>)
- using render props instead of HOC
- prevent double submit
